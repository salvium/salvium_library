# Salvium Research & Audit Repository

This repository contains research papers, technical documentation, audits, and preprints related to the Salvium project - a privacy-focused blockchain with staking, DeFi capabilities, and regulatory compliance features.

## Repository Structure

-   **audits/** - Independent security audits and code reviews of implemented protocol
-   **papers/** - Published research papers and litepapers (in multiple languages)
-   **preprints/** - Mathematical audits and theoretical validations of protocol design prior to implementation

## Audits

The `audits/` directory contains security audits performed on the implemented codebase by third-party security firms:

-   `SPARC_maths_audit.pdf` - Mathematical validation of Salvium's cryptographic foundations
-   `cypher_stack_audit_July_2024.pdf` - Comprehensive security review of core protocol components by Cypher Stack

## Lite Papers

The `papers/` directory contains the official Salvium litepaper in multiple languages:

-   English: `salvium-litepaper-v1_0-english.pdf`
-   Chinese: `salvium-litepaper-v1_0-chinese.pdf`
-   French: `salvium-litepaper-v1_0-french.pdf`
-   German: `salvium-litepaper-v1_0-german.pdf`
-   Japanese: `salvium-litepaper-v1_0-japanese.pdf`
-   Korean: `salvium-litepaper-v1_0-korean.pdf`
-   Spanish: `salvium-litepaper-v1_0-spanish.pdf`

## Preprints

The `preprints/` directory contains mathematical audits and theoretical validations of cryptographic constructions before implementation:

-   `SPARC_preprint_v0.4.pdf` - Mathematical analysis and validation of protocol design before code implementation

These preprints verify the mathematical soundness of cryptographic primitives and protocol design before any code is written, ensuring theoretical security properties are preserved.
